                    <h4>If you thought Indonesia was all big resorts and Bintang, it might be time to check your atlas.</h4>
                    <p>Because there isn’t really just one Indonesia, not when you’re an archipelago made up of 17,000 individual islands (only 8,000 of which have ever seen a human footprint). One minute you’re spotting orangutans in the jungles of Sumatra, the next you’re chowing down on an organic acai bowl in Ubud, hiking the slopes of Mt Batur or kicking back on the sugar-white beaches of Gili Air (preferably holding a some ridiculous, tropical-looking cocktail). Every day in Indonesia is different, so whether you’re after party, peace or paradise, the odds are good we’ve got an Indonesia tour that fits the bill.</p>
                    <p>Indonesia represents a vast number of islands. In fact, the country, which lies in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and between Oceania and Southeast Asia, makes up over 17,000 islands. Some of the well-known isles include Java, Borneo, New Guinea, and Sulawesi. Therefore, trips to Indonesia, feature travels by boat, and once-in-a-lifetime tropical excursions. If you are seeking adventure or wish to truly escape, an escorted island tour is something to strongly consider. Plus, you don't have to necessarily travel to the main islands on your trip. There are plenty of adventures waiting in the lesser-known island locales. With tour operator volume buys plus our low everyday prices you can save up to 40% versus assembling the same itinerary on your own! Book your Indonesia tour today with AffordableTours.com, your discounted tour headquarters. </p>
